# Railway Configuration for Desktop Next.js Web App
# IMPORTANT: This deploys ONLY the Next.js web app (NOT Electron)
# 
# Desktop app now uses external auth service (apps/auth)
# No database connection needed in desktop app
#
# In Railway Dashboard:
# 1. Settings → Source → Root Directory: Leave EMPTY (use repo root)
# 2. Settings → Build → Builder: Use "Nixpacks" or "Railpack" (Default)
# 3. Settings → Build → Build Command: Override with: pnpm install && cd apps/desktop && pnpm install && pnpm run build:skip

[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
# Install deps and build (no Prisma needed - uses external auth service)
buildCommand = "pnpm install && cd apps/desktop && pnpm install && pnpm run build:skip"

[deploy]
# Dev script already generates Prisma client, just start it
startCommand = "cd apps/desktop && pnpm dev"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
