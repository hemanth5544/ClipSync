# Railway Configuration for Go Backend
# IMPORTANT: In Railway Dashboard:
# 1. Settings → Source → Root Directory: Set to "apps/backend"
# 2. Settings → Build → Builder: Change from "Railpack" to "Dockerfile"
# This prevents Railway from detecting Node.js and using Railpack

# Use Dockerfile for build (most reliable way to ensure Go build)
